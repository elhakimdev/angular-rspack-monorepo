> **Next-Generation Angular Architecture.** Engineered for extreme performance, scalability, and developer experience.

## 📖 Overview

This project demonstrates a high-performance **Micro Frontend** architecture suitable for enterprise scale. It moves away from the traditional Webpack-based Angular CLI in favor of **Rsbuild (Rspack)**—a Rust-based bundler that offers 10x faster compilation.

Orchestrated by **Turborepo**, this monorepo features intelligent caching, isolated build outputs, and a seamless **Module Federation** setup where the Shell application lazy-loads remote modules based on routing.

## 🏗 Architecture Diagram

The system uses a **Source Dependency** pattern for internal libraries (Zero-Build) and **Module Federation** for application composition.

    end
    
    subgraph "Shared Packages (Source Code)"
        UI[@auth/primitives-ui]
        Logger[@auth/logger]
    end

# 🌟 Key Features
## ⚡Rus-Powered Performance Built with Rsbuild (Rspack).

- Cold Start: < 300ms (vs 5s+ with Webpack).

- HMR: Instantaneous (millisecond-response), O(1) scalability.

- Bundling: Efficient tree-shaking and minification closer to native speeds.

## 🧩 Native Micro Frontends
Implemented using the ```@module-federation/rsbuild-plugin```.

- Shell App: Handles layout, global navigation, and authentication state.

- Remote Apps: Loaded lazily only when the user navigates to specific routes (e.g., /login).

- Shared Context: Singleton instances of Angular Core, Router, and Shared Services.

## 📦 Smart Monorepo Strategy
- Powered by Turborepo.

- Remote Caching: Never rebuild the same code twice.

- Isolated Outputs: Each app builds into its own local dist folder (apps/client/shell/dist), ensuring clean Docker containerization.

- Source Dependencies: Internal libraries (ui, logger) are consumed as raw TypeScript. No complex library build steps required during development.

## 🛡 Enterprise Logging
- Custom wrapper around Pino Logger.

- Browser-Friendly: Pretty-printed, expandable objects in Chrome DevTools.

- Secure by Default: Automatic redaction of sensitive fields (password, token, secret) before logging.

- Isomorphic: Works seamlessly in both Node.js (build time) and Browser (runtime).

## ⚖️ Performance Comparison
- Feature,Standard Angular CLI (Webpack),This Architecture (Rsbuild)
- Build Engine,Javascript (Webpack),Rust (Rspack)
- Dev Server Start,2s - 10s (Scales linearly),< 300ms (Constant)
- HMR Speed,1s - 3s,< 50ms
- Monorepo DX,Complex angular.json paths,Simple pnpm workspaces
- Micro Frontend,Requires external libraries,Native Plugin Support

## 🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
- Node.js v20+
- pnpm (Recommended)

Installation
1. Clone The Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/angular-rsbuild-monorepo.git](https://github.com/yourusername/angular-rsbuild-monorepo.git)
cd angular-rsbuild-monorepo
```

2. Install dependency
```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Run Development Server Start both Shell and Remote applications in parallel.
```bash
pnpm dev
```
- Shell: http://localhost:4200
## 🛠 Build Pipeline & Environments
The project uses a single-config strategy. The build command automatically injects the correct environment variables and optimizations based on NODE_ENV.
Command,Environment,Source Maps,Minification,Use Case
pnpm build:qa,QA,✅ Yes,✅ Yes,For Testers (Debuggable)
pnpm build:staging,Staging,❌ No,✅ Yes,Pre-Production Simulation
pnpm build:prod,Production,❌ No,✅ Aggressive,Live Deployment

Run a specific build:
```bash
pnpm build:prod
```
